# Gravity

Gravity is a minigame developed by [Henrique Simões][10] and [Max Braz][11] using the [Godot engine][0] and the [GodotWare project][1]. It's been developed during the Gamux — a Unicamp entity — workshops.

## How does it work

The game itself consists on a survival game in which a character continuously fells down from the sky and has to avoid hitting the ground by going through a free-from-rock path. For doing so, the player has to control the character's horizontal moves, fighting against the Gravity — which pulls it down fast each second.


## How to install and run it

For installing it, you have to do the following steps.
1. Download the [Gotdot Engine][0];
1. Download the source code of the [GodotWare project][1] or ``git clone`` it;
1. Extract or move it to a directory you want (e.g. /home/);
1. Download this repository source code or ``git clone`` it;
1. Extract or move it to the ``GotdotWare2/Minigames/`` folder.
